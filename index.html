<h1>GitHub.io Assignment</h1>
<p>My name is Isaiah Velazquez, and I am from Locke, New York, in the Finger Lakes Region. I attended high school at Tyburn Academy, a small Catholic School in Auburn. My favorite subjects in high school were math and history. <br> 
    My favorite hobby is playing games, but I also like messing with computers and writing random bits of code. I also like to cook, although I can't right now because I don't have a kitchen in my dorm.
